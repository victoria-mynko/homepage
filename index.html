                  <h2>Résumé</h2>
                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                    like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but
                    my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not
                    your fault.</p>

                    other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                    and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                    million to settle that...</p>

                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!</p>

                    workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a
                    repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95
                    million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
